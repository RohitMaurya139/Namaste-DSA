## 🧠 THEORY: The Sentinel (Dummy) Node Concept

### What is a Sentinel (Dummy) Node?

A **sentinel node** (also called a **dummy node**) is a special, artificial node placed before the actual head of a linked list.  

It doesn’t hold meaningful data — it just helps simplify pointer logic.

#### Example

**Before using dummy node:**
```text
[1] → [2] → [3]
head → [1]
```

**With dummy node:**
```text
[dummy] → [1] → [2] → [3]
dummy.next → head
```

---

### 🎯 Purpose of the Sentinel Node

The sentinel node helps handle **edge cases** uniformly — especially when the **head node might be deleted**.

#### Example without dummy node

Suppose the list is:
```text
[6, 1, 2, 6, 3]
```
and you want to remove all `6`s.

When you start:
- `head` points to a node that might need to be deleted.  
- But if you delete the head, you lose the reference to the list — unless you handle it specially.

You’d have to write:
```js
while (head && head.val === val) {
    head = head.next;
}
```
and then handle the rest separately — **messy and error-prone!**

### ✅ With Dummy Node

By adding a dummy node before the head:
```text
[dummy] → [6] → [1] → [2] → [6] → [3]
```

Now:
- Even if the first node (`6`) must be removed, you can handle it using the same logic:
  ```js
  pre.next = pre.next.next;
  ```
- You **never need special handling** for the head.

This makes the code **cleaner**, **safer**, and **more consistent**.

## 🧩 Summary: Why Sentinel (Dummy) Node Is Useful

| Without Dummy Node                                        | With Dummy Node                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Need special logic when deleting the head                 | Head deletion handled naturally          |
| Code is more complex                                      | Code is cleaner and uniform              |
| Might lose reference to head                              | Dummy node always keeps a safe reference |
| Common in “Remove”, “Insert Before”, and “Merge” problems | Common best-practice technique           |

## 🔍 Real-world Analogy

Think of the **dummy node** like a **“guard”** or **“placeholder”** at the start of the list —  
it doesn’t participate in the data, but it **keeps the door open** so you can safely modify or delete nodes (even the first ones) without losing access to the list.
